<h2>Supervised Graduate Research Projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Center Bias in Forward and Backward Heading Perception (2024.9– )</b><br>
    Used psychophysics and Bayesian modeling to investigate how locomotion experience shapes asymmetric priors in heading perception.<br>
    Presented at the <i>2025 China Experimental Psychology Conference</i> 
    (Talk, Chengdu, China, <a href="{{ '/files/CGPEP2025-Bao.pdf' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">Slides</a>) 
    and the <i>2024 China Vision Science Conference</i> 
    (<a href="{{ '/files/CVCS2024_Bao.pdf' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">Poster</a>, Guangzhou, China).<br>
    <i>Role:</i> Led the project from inception, including experimental design, supervision of data collection, data analysis (psychometric fitting, modeling), and manuscript drafting.

    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Temporal Dynamics of Heading and Scene-Relative Object Motion Judgments (2024.2– )</b><br>
    Used psychophysics to investigate how the precision of heading and scene-relative object motion judgments changes with optic flow duration.<br>
    Presented at the <i>2024 China Vision Science Conference</i> 
    (<a href="{{ '/files/CVCS2024_Ji.pdf' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">Poster</a>, Guangzhou, China).<br>
    <i>Role:</i> Led the project from conception through execution: designed the experiment, supervised data collection and analysis, drafted the manuscript, and facilitated discussions on subsequent research directions.

<h2>Collaborative Projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Visual Discomfort in Head-Mounted Displays (2021, Industry Collaboration)</b><br>
    This project examined and quantified how prolonged viewing through a head-mounted display (HMD) leads to visual discomfort.<br>
    Conducted in collaboration with an industry partner to improve VR ergonomics and user experience.<br>
    <i>Role:</i> Contributed to programming (VR eye-tracking using Vizard), data collection, and data analysis.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Brain Maturation and Development of Ocular Tracking in Children (2020– )</b><br>
    This research aims to examine the development of ocular tracking ability (eye-tracking) and the brain structural (structural MRI) changes with age.<br>

    (<a href="{{ '/files/Neuroscience2024_BrainCorrelates.pdf' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">Poster</a>, Chicago, USA), 
    the <i>2023 China Experimental Psychology Conference</i>

    <i>Role:</i> Contributed to stimulus design and programming, data collection, and data analysis.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Undergraduate research (Early Work)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Parallel Processing of Optic Flow and Object Motion (2020, Undergraduate thesis)</b><br>
    Used psychophysical paradigms to investigate how global optic flow and local object motion are concurrently processed during self-movement .<br>
    Results suggested partially independent motion pathways for flow parsing and object-motion segregation.<br>

  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Implicit Associations Between Power Concepts and Vertical Space (2019)</b><br>
    Used the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to examine implicit associations between power concepts and vertical spatial metaphors.<br>
    Findings demonstrated faster congruent responses for high–up and low–down pairings, supporting the embodied mapping of abstract concepts.<br>
