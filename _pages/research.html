<h2>Ph.D. Research Projects</h2>

<p>My doctoral research investigates how recent sensory history shapes current perception, combining psychophysics, eye-tracking, EEG, and computational modeling.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Serial Dependence in Smooth Pursuit of Preadolescent Children and Adults (2021–2024)</b><br>
    Used eye-tracking to investigate whether ocular tracking exhibits serial dependence and its developmental aspects.<br>
    Presented at the <a href="https://cvsc.net.cn/2023/en_index.html" target="_blank"><i>2023 China Vision Science Conference</i></a> (Talk, Zhejiang, China); Published in <a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/" target="_blank"><i>Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science</i></a> (2024).<br>

  <li>
    <b>Neural Evidence of Serial Dependence in Ocular Tracking (2024.10– )</b><br>
    Used EEG and eye-tracking to investigate how trial-history information is represented in visual cortical activity and modulated by alpha-band oscillations.<br>
    Abstract to be presented at the <a href="https://www.sfn.org/" target="_blank"><i>Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting (SfN 2025)</i></a> (Poster, San Diego, USA); Manuscript to be submitted.

<h2>Supervised Graduate Research Projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Center Bias in Forward and Backward Heading Perception (2024.9– )</b><br>
    Used psychophysics and Bayesian modeling to investigate how locomotion experience shapes asymmetric priors in heading perception.<br>
    Presented at the <a href="https://cepac.nwu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><i>2025 China Experimental Psychology Conference</i></a> (Talk, Chengdu, China).<br>
    <i>Role:</i> Led the project from inception, including experimental design, supervision of data collection, data analysis (psychometric fitting, modeling), and manuscript drafting.

    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Temporal Dynamics of Heading and Scene-Relative Object Motion Judgments (2024.2– )</b><br>
    Used psychophysics to investigate how the precision of heading and scene-relative object motion judgments changes with optic flow duration.<br>
    Presented at the <a href="https://cvsc.net.cn/2024/en_index.html" target="_blank"><i>2024 China Vision Science Conference</i></a> (Poster, Guangzhou, China).<br>
    <i>Role:</i> Led the project from conception through execution: designed the experiment, supervised data collection and analysis, drafted the manuscript, and facilitated discussions on subsequent research directions.

<h2>Collaborative Projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Visual Discomfort in Head-Mounted Displays (2021, Industry Collaboration)</b><br>
    This project examined and quantified how prolonged viewing through a head-mounted display (HMD) leads to visual discomfort.<br>
    Conducted in collaboration with an industry partner to improve VR ergonomics and user experience.<br>
    <i>Role:</i> Contributed to programming (VR eye-tracking using Vizard), data collection, and data analysis.
