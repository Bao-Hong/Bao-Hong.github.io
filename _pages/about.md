I am Bao Hong (洪宝 in Chinese), a second-year PhD candidate in cognitive neuroscience at East China Normal University, working with Dr. Li Li in the [Perception and Action Lab at New York University Shanghai](https://wp.nyu.edu/perception_action_lab/). Before that, I received B.s. in appied psychology from Nanchang University in China in 2020.

I am currently interested in visual motion perception, investigating perceptual biases in continuous responses, such as serial dependence, using behavioral approaches (psychophysics, eye-tracking, and VR), EEG, and computational modeling. Additionally, I am also engaged in research on the developmental aspects of visual motion perception in children.
