I am Bao Hong (洪宝), a third-year PhD candidate in cognitive neuroscience at East China Normal University, working with Dr. [Li Li](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/li-li) in the [Perception and Action Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/perception_action_lab/) at New York University Shanghai. Prior to this, I received a B.S. in Applied Psychology (2016–2020) and a Minor in Computer Science and Technology (2018–2019) from Nanchang University, China.

I am broadly interested in visual perception and how the brain integrates information over time. My Ph.D. research focuses on how past experiences influence current perception, using psychophysics, eye-tracking, EEG, and computational modeling to investigate the neural and computational mechanisms underlying perceptual biases. Additionally, I am engaged in research on the developmental aspects of visual motion perception in children.
