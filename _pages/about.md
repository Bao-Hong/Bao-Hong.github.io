I am Bao Hong (洪宝 in Chinese), a second-year PhD candidate in cognitive neuroscience at East China Normal University, working with Dr. Li Li in the [Perception and Action Lab at New York University Shanghai](https://wp.nyu.edu/perception_action_lab/). Before that, I received a B.S. in Applied Psychology (2016–2020) and a Minor in Computer Science and Technology (2018–2019) from Nanchang University, China.

I am currently interested in visual motion perception, investigating perceptual biases in continuous responses, such as serial dependence, using behavioral approaches (psychophysics, eye-tracking, and VR), EEG, and computational modeling. Additionally, I am also engaged in research on the developmental aspects of visual motion perception in children.
